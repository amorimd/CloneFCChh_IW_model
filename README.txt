Change the name of the scenario in the script to change the folder where the impedance files
will be written

Use the scripts only to compute impedances:
   ./BSH_coll launch
   ./BSH_coll retrieve


Circ = 101898.2192
BSH_coll: beam screen + pumping holes + collimators (C and W)
BS_coll: beam screen + collimators


Circ = 11/3 CircLHC = 11/3*26658.883 = 97749.2377
BS_coll_shorter1: beam screen + collimators
